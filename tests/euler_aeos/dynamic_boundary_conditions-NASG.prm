# Test the Euler AEOS dynamic boundary conditions by setting up a
# stationary isentropic vortex on a very small domain. We use the noble
# Abel stiffened gas equation of state with nonzero covolume, reference
# pressure p_\infty and specific internal energy q.
#
# Note that the final error we are getting is the same as the one for
# Dirichlet boundary conditions.
