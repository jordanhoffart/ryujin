# Euler AEOS benchmark
#
# A 1D benchmark configuration consisting of two "strong rarefaction waves". See section  "Strong rarefaction waves" in [1] for details.
#
# This configuration uses an explicit ERK(3, 3, 1) timestepping. Expected
# results are reported in verification-nasg_smooth_wave-1d-erk33-l9.output.
# If used with the `prm/create_convergence_tables` script, the output of the prm file should give 3rd order accuracy in the L^1 norm.
