# Shallow water benchmark:
#
# A 1D benchmark configuration consisting of a planar surface flow in a
# radially-symmetric paraboloid basin without friction. See Section 4.2.2
# of [1] for details.
#
# This configuration uses an explicit ERK(3, 3, 1) timestepping. Expected
# results are reported in shallow_water-paraboloid_1d-erk33.baseline
