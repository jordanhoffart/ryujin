#
# Shallow water benchmark:
#
# The smooth vortex is an analytic solution of the shallow water equations.
# We compute the vortex on the square [-5, 5]^2 initially centered at
# (-1,-1) with a strength of beta=5, and moving in diagonal (1,1) direction
# with mach number 1. At final time t=2 the vortex is located at (1, 1). We
# report the final, normalized L1, L2, L\infty error norms summed up over
# all components.
#
# This configuration uses an explicit ERK(3, 3, 1) timestepping.
# Expected results are reported in euler-isentropic_vortex-erk33.baseline
