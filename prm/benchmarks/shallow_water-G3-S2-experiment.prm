# "G2-S2" experiment reproduced from [1]
#
# The geometry is the rectangle [0, 6.0078m] x [-0.12,0.12m] which are the 
# direct measurements of the wave flume from the experiment. 
# On the left, "dirichlet moment" inflow conditions are encforced
# and on the right outflow boundary, we enforce "dynamic" conditions.
# On all other boundaries (top and bottom boundary of the flume) slip boundary 
# conditions are enforced.
#
# The chosen refinement level 3 corresponds to around 928,137 degrees of 
# freedom, which requires around 39k time steps and runs
# for about 0.5h with 128 ranks / 2 threads on a modern system.
#
# The final time is set to t = 50.0 and we output a vtk every δt = 10s. For
# postprocessing the simulation into a nice video set the output frequency
# to δt = = 0.1.
